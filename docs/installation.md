# Installation

This guide will briefly guide you through installing the required software to run the code generator.

## Node JS & NPM

1. Download the Windows installer from the [Nodes.js® web site](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
3. Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
4. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js® until you restart your computer.

## Running the generator

1. Clone or download the generator files to a location on your PC.
2. Open Command Prompt or Windows Powershell (Windows), terminal (Mac), or any bash shell on other platforms
3. Move to the directory where you downloaded the generator
4. Type `npm install -g` to install the `colongygen` command directly into your bash profile

You can now call the generator by typing `colongygen <options>` in your chosen command line software. For help on how to use the command type `colongygen --help`.
