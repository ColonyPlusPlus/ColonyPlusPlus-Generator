# ColonyPlus Plus Code Generator

The purpose of this project is to allow the easy addition of numerous blocks to the base game, without the need to manually modify Colony Survival JSON files with every release. The basic principle is that any overrides are held in a self contained mod system, then when running the mod the mod's JSON's are merged/generated and merged with the game JSON. This means *only* the mod's JSON needs to be maintained, and the application does the heavy lifting.
